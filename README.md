# ðŸš€ Applied Data Science Capstone â€“ SpaceX Launch Analysis

This repository contains my final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It showcases a full data science workflow using SpaceX launch data â€” from data collection to building a machine learning model and an interactive dashboard.

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The objective of this capstone is to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings, a key factor in SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse rockets and reduce costs.

Throughout the project, I applied:

* Data collection from APIs and web scraping
* Data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* SQL queries for structured analysis
* Geospatial visualization of launch sites
* Interactive dashboard creation with Dash
* Machine learning model development and evaluation

### ðŸš€ Technologies Used

* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly
* **APIs & Web Scraping:** Requests, BeautifulSoup
* **Databases:** SQLite, SQL queries
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVM, GridSearchCV)
* **Dashboard:** Dash / Plotly
* Jupyter Notebooks

### ðŸ“ˆ Results

â€“  Developed multiple machine learning models to predict rocket landing success.

â€“  Achieved best performance with the KNN Model at **90%** *training* accuracy and **94%** *test* accuracy.

â€“  Created an interactive dashboard which allows dynamic exploration of launch success by site, payload, and orbit.
